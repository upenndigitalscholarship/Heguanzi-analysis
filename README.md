# Heguanzi-analysis
An epistemic network analysis of semantic patterns in ancient Chinese texts

Introduction

The objective of this project is to utilize Epistemic Network Analysis (ENA) techniques to uncover and visualize semantic patterns related to key themes in the ancient Chinese text "鹖冠子" ("Heguanzi"). "鹖冠子" is an influential Daoist text believed to have been authored by a hermit named "鹖冠子" during the Warring States period in the state of Chu. This philosophical work encompasses aspects of Daoism, Legalism, and the art of war. It continues to be studied for its timeless wisdom and its significance in the ancient Chinese philosophical landscape.

## Research Steps
1. Literature Review: Find relevant scholarly papers related to "鹖冠子" and its themes to gain a comprehensive understanding of existing research.
2. Identify Common Themes: Distill commonly studied themes from the scholarly papers, which will serve as the basis for the coding process.
3. Code Definitions: Construct code definitions based on the identified themes, capturing the semantic patterns within the text.
4. Refine Code Definitions: Refine the code definitions to ensure they accurately capture the specific context and nuances of "鹖冠子."
5. Segmentation: Split the text into individual sentences to facilitate the coding process.
6. Create Dataset: Create a dataset that includes section-level (上 or 中) and chapter-level (卷一 to 卷十九) information for each sentence.
7. Coding: Code the dataset using the defined themes, analyzing each sentence and assigning relevant codes.
8. ChatGPT as Second Coder: Utilize ChatGPT as a second coder to independently code the dataset, providing alternative insights and perspectives.
9. Inter-Rater Reliability: Calculate the inter-rater reliability between the human coder and ChatGPT to assess agreement and disagreement.
10. Discussion of Disagreements: Discuss any disagreements between the human coder and ChatGPT, exploring the reasons behind divergent coding decisions.
11. Resolution of Disagreements: Resolve any disagreements through consensus or manual intervention, ensuring the final coding accurately reflects the intended meanings.
12. Network Visualization: Visualize the semantic network based on the coded dataset, representing the relationships between different themes and concepts.
13. Difference Networks: Construct difference network for the 上 (upper) and 中 (middle) sections of "鹖冠子" to observe potential variations in semantic patterns.
14. Preliminary Interpretations: Conduct preliminary interpretations of the visualized networks, extracting insights and implications related to the key themes of the text.

In this repository, we provide the definition of codes, code to split the text into sentences, and the CSV file with the split sentences ready for coding.
